    description: `Oh! I see you've found your way down to my section at last! Don't worry, I'll try to assure you, it's bursting with potential. Can you believe I'm the oldest of them all? I certainly don't act like it! After a few centuries or millennia, mages inevitably start to suffer from IID — Immortally Induced Depression — in which days pass by like seconds, and the world's events feel so repetitive, so pointless, so boring. That's about when they usually 'retire'... but being a Daughter, that wasn't an option for me, obviously. So, every few centuries or so, I copy my psyche to upload it into the Aether, and then, as for my physical body... I wipe most of its memories! It's like being born again. In reality, I'm not all that much older than yourself, at least mentally. This means unlike my family, I can look at everything with a fresh perspective, and I have more energy to engage with our mages on a one-on-one basis. There's nothing I love more than suddenly visiting a new young mage, and seeing the starstruck smile on their face!

I used to simply offer the broadest selection of blessings and spells, since mages would keep coming to me with new and I wouldn't be able to resist adding them to the repertoire. Eventually, the Mother came up to me with a better idea: why not just allow each mage to create their own, custom spells? Of course, most mages are never allowed one of these treasured sigils, but since you're one of those special ones, I don't see why I couldn't make an exception...`

    description: `What an exciting opportunity you have here! Have an entirely unique idea for a spell that you haven't seen offered by any of the other blessings or mages, or maybe you just want to make a slightly different version of an existing spell, customized according to your exact preferences? The other mages will seethe with jealousy once they've noticed you've gotten your grubby mits onto one of these super rare sigils!

However, I must warn you these don't have the "satisfaction guaranteed" status of premade spells, since they haven't undergone nearly as much refinement. I've found the more powerful one tries to make a custom spell, the higher the chances are that it will backfire dramatically on them, especially when it comes to Ruhai sigils. Basically, if you want to push spells to their limits in order to utterly cheese fights, you'd have better luck doing it with the existing powers.`

For example, a spell that involves temperature control would fit into Metathermics. These must be fairly limited in scope, and therefore cannot fit into multiple categories at once. For example, just because you took Telekinetics does not mean that you can alter the cells of your body in a way that would encroach on the territory of Transformation. You also cannot create any spells in the Metamagic category, or any spells that would involve creating a companion, beast, vehicle, or weapon on the Reference Page. You also can't play with temporal magic (time travel is always overpowered). Basically, these spells should be on the level of a Kaarn or low-level Purth-tier spell.",

They can either be more unique, fitting into multiple predefined spell categories at once or none at all; or they can be more powerful, while still being limited to one category. Of course, this still does not mean you can have an 'all-in-one' spell; you have to make a good faith attempt to stick to your premise and avoid turning the power into an instant win button. Anything that would fit into the category of Metamagic or temporal manipulation is still off-limits, but you can now create vehicles, weapons, etc. and grant yourself up to 100 Points on the Reference Page to do so, as well as add custom modifications that were not included on the Reference Page. These spells should be on the level of a high-level Purth or a Xuth-tier spell (though the latter will still require a trial).",
