    description: `We treat IID as if its some sort of medical syndrome, when in reality, it's human psychology. As you experience everything there is to experience, every day seems to go by faster than the one before; within a millennium or two, entire decades are flying past in what feels like the blink of an eye. Events that once seemed so shocking or exciting to you become hopelessly mundane, all of history feels looped as the same old fables repeating over and over and over again, with no true progress and nothing new under the sun. While your actions may seem world-altering for a few centuries, everything you do is eventually relegated to the history books as the world moves on, and another legend rises to solve some new problem that seems eerily similar to one you already "solved" long ago. You come to be seen as old-fashioned, hopelessly out of touch with the hundreds of generations that came after you, who've evolved so drastically that you're just as disgusted by them as they are by you. No wonder so many people make arrangements for... retirement.

Of course, retirement is not literally death. There's no reason your story has to end there. Instead, consider it a fresh start — a new beginning. But if this world ever gets too boring for you, it may be time to think of moving on to another one. No need to retire anytime soon, though; in fact, it'd be smartest if you'd stick around until we've figured out this whole 'destabilization' thing, as if our verse shuts down, these 'afterlives' will shut down too.`

It is described as a patchwork quilt of countless procedurally generated verses, each with their own strange denizens, mysteries to be solved and adventures to be had. The societies there work entirely different from our own, so it might be a breath of fresh air if our world is feeling dull. Best for the adventurous types, though it can be dangerous.",

Unlike our world and the Aether, it is a place of absolute relaxation, and you feel a sort of tranquility just walking along its beautiful streets. Its appearance changes from person to person depending on your preferences, and there's leagues of virtual assistants mulling around ready to follow your demands. No adventuring, but lots of relaxing, swimming, gaming, and etc to be had.",

    description: `Look, I understand. We all felt the same way once, when we were young. But I'm afraid it's simply impossible. Plenty have tried before you, only to find the entire world uniting against them, countless mages banding together to prevent one's naivete from dooming us all. I mean, just look around you. We've created a world without war, without hunger or thirst or disa— hell, one day all hardship will be eliminated completely. Having grown up with it, you might take it for granted, but it's impossible to overstate how extraordinary that is. And what's the alternative? Without our magic, the Allmillor will tear the Earth to tatters within months. Leave only empty ruins hovering over the Othersky, devoid of life, until the simulation shuts down. Is that really the future you envision?

Do you think we're merely sadists? Have you seen her quarters? She practically lives in luxury. The Mother herself sings her a lullaby every night, for goodness sakes. What we had to do to her — and her father — is tragic, yes, but we're doing everything she can to make her as comfortable as possible. There's a reason we only make new mages once a year. We endeavour to minimize the strain on her as much as possible.

Damn it, think about what you're doing. Do you know what things were like before? We'd been forsaken by our only god. The planet dried up, and almost every harvest died in the scorching heat. Globe-spanning wars were fought over what little resources remained, despotic warlords having entire populations massacred over a single well's worth of water. Plagues battered the few warm survivors, leaving living corpses limping through the streets, their flesh sloughing from their bones. What were we supposed to do? We're not proud of what we've done, but it was a grim necessity. None of us would be here otherwise.

Would you really doom the entire world for the sake of a single child?`,
