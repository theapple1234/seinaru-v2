This blessing is pretty much used by every mage who's ever lived -- I genuinely can't think of a single one who hadn't taken it, or at least, not one who survived long enough to be remembered. There was a time, during the war, that the Mother considered making this the only blessing people were allowed access to, but the arrival of the Allmillor put the kibosh on that.

Perhaps most important is the included durability. Battles between mages can go on for hours, and even when at the point they'd normally die, they instead fall unconscious. Killing a mage would essentially require you to coup de grace them while they're knocked out, which is still surprisingly difficult. This blessing cannot be applied to weapons.`

She's appeared at various times throughout history to save all mankind whenever it needed her most, most notably leading Gohwood's Holy Knights during the war, so she's beloved by all but the most cynical souls and has become the de facto mascot of mages in general. Believe me when I say Jipangu has made a ton of cartoons about her. Unfortunately, I fear that deep down, she has come to despise her own fame. I can always sense that she wishes she could just be a normal girl, and not some symbol eternally looked away in her gilded palace on Eden. The Mother reminds her that she serves the people best as a symbol, a beacon of hope, a graceful protector, a role model for them all to aspire to. Still, I've heard whispers she lets her moonlight disguised as a normal mage and go on adventures down on Earth, from time to time. Keep an eye out, and maybe, you just might meet her...
    
Her blessings are so straight-forward and pragmatic that many mages don't really bother to study anything beyond them. Simple things like throwing fireballs, conjuring familiars, moving heavy objects... you know, all the things that immediately spring to mind when you think 'magic'. Some hipsters laugh at this brand of magic for being 'boring' and 'soulless', but I think, deep down, they must regret having passed over such useful, fundamental spells...`

Essentially, this Blessing encompasses the incredibly broad concept of 'mental manipulation of energy' -- a.k.a. telekinesis. This is useful even in regular day-to-day life: it's like having a dozen extra pairs of hands! Plus, once you start manipulating things on the atomic level, you can get very creative...

    description: `Once thought to just be a form of temporal magic limited to organic tissue, it was unknown what it was useful for besides age manipulation and making crops grow, up until the two Brannigan Sisters, Eleanore and Genevieve. They found that by applying this Blessing in very specific ways, they could not only accelerate or reverse natural processes, they could modify them. Eleanor, a simple girl, dabbled in only the most practical applications of this art, but Genevieve, ever the scientist, delved deeper, perfecting truly amazing techniques with the ambition of one day inventing perfect immortality and invincibility. It seems she took her research too far, however, and abandoned it out of horror.
    
A side note: on undead creatures, this magic actually increases the rate at which they rot, rather than heal. Therefore, it's possible to actually deal damage to them in this way. It's very entertaining!`

Even the illustrious Garden of Eden, hidden away above our facade of a sky, was created as a gift by a father for his daughter, for he was dissatisfied with the harsh realities of the universe from which he came. Poor Priscillia was filled with dissatisfaction, never taken seriously even by her own family -- a feeling she harnessed when she, within minutes, weaved an entire army of puppet warriors to fend off a Sinthru attack on early Halidew Station, in an act that stunned the magical world and cemented this Blessing as essential.
    
Contrary to popular belief, this is the blessing of change, not creation. You cannot create things via alchemy, only change their form, sacrificing something to obtain something else of relatively equal value.`

    description: `The middle child among the Daughters, and by far the most mysterious and mired in rumors. Even I only rarely see her emerge from the twilight depths of the old Garden of Eden. Yet, at the same time, she is also the one most likely to personally connect with her followers, with many reporting her appearing to them in times of great need or visiting them in their dreams. This personableness has led her to fame... and scandals. As the Sinthru covens ravaged the land, outrage spread over revelations that she'd been seen consorted with high-ranking coven members before the revolt, to the point of being Elvira's lover. And she was always the Daughter who felt the most sympathy for the Child of God...
    
Of course, the official position is that she was never involved with the Sinthru covens, and is actually just misunderstood -- she is, after all, something of a patron saint for misunderstood mages. She oversees all the magic with dreadful and dark reputations -- such as necromancy -- but which actually hold great beauty and utility, and she supports all those who are maligned or mistreated for failing to conform to society's standards. Her campaigns have been very successful over the millenia, and now, people tend to be very accepting of even the most extreme of differences. So really, there's no need to believe those silly rumors! She's such a kind girl, it kills me to see her plagued by all these silly conspiracy theories. Especially all of those absurd ones about her sealing away an entire Blessincxvqmeuywitpdrrinbojkgt.`

However, certain strange phenomena take place between life and death, the process of which forms spirits. These spirits aren't the full-fledged person, but a schismatic echo, like the residue of all their emotions and experiences left in the halls of time, with an origin akin to Distortions. As our reality destabilizes, these spirits become more prominent, and those who control them more powerful.
    
Further research into this discipline has yielded means of imbuing those spirits into corpses in order to create creatures somewhere in between the boundaries of life and death. Even the most advanced of these grotesque creatures cannot be exactly the same person they used to be, and their new personalities trend towards being more... macabre.`

Obviously, this could not last long. To prevent an uprising, in the Sinthru Covenant, the Mother offered these mages immense influence over the world's politics via voting in the newly established Red-Jade Council, and Margra was birthed to serve as their intermediary. Some say the Red-Jade Council is a glorified social club; a bunch of bored old corporate CEOs getting together to play bingo and gossip like schoolgirls. Others say they're the true power behind the throne, cementing their influence through artificial scarcity and pulling all the strings while the Mother slowly devolves into a ceremonial figurehead. (I will say, if that last one were true, Mother would probably be quite pleased with the arrangement, in my opinion. She never was one for geopolitics.)

Her spells are probably the most rarely studied of all of them, for they're far less straightforward and generally require more significant amounts of thought and creativity put into how they can be used — you won't find any good old projectile spells in her arsenal! However, if you put in the legwork and are the clever sort, you'll find that the blessings she offers are often the best a mage could hope for. In fact, she offers far more Xuth-level spells than any of the other daughters! Just know you may be vulnerable if the direct combat-oriented mages catch you off your guard.`

Another bonus: a few decades ago, Laser Focus Inc. accidentally leaked a bunch of experimental self-replicating nanites, and by now they've proliferated the entire atmosphere a trillion times over.

Metamagic was its earliest form back in the hazy primal eras; shortly after, almost everyone on Earth enjoyed some sort of magical ability, and they experimented with ways to push these powers to the limits. As society grew more complex, we even learned how to harness arcane matter. Once upon a time, the mere presence of a mage would incur surges, saps and dips in all nearby electrical circuits, but nowadays, most electronics have been thoroughly 'magic-proofed' (although powerful spells or big battles have still been known to cause blackouts). This has brought on a new era of magitech, which has birthed some incredible luxuries. The difference between them all, can, perhaps, be most easily explained by the continuum between tech and magic: Magitech is heavy on the tech side of things, and metamagic on the magic side, while arcane constructs are half-and-half."

    description: `In her great magnanimity, the Mother does not mind Mages drawing power from sources other than herself. Plenty of other entities have obtained great power they can share with you, either through Theosis, drawing from the divinity of the Child of God like the Mother, or by taking advantage of distortions in the framework of our universe, or other even more esoteric means. However, while the Mother tries to be laissez faire with her 'subjects' — often to her detriment — other entities won't be so kind, and will make demands of you. Displease them, and they'll take back their powers.
    
In my opinion, if there's ever a new Doctrine, this blessing will be the first to go. It's driven too many mages to turn on their sisters or go on rampages. The Mother always leans towards freedom, but if you study the history carefully, you'll realize that pretty much every problem that exists in our universe came about because she was too lenient...`
